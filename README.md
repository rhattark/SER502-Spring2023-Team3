<br>

```
The grand design, forsooth, to marry the realms of yon computer programming and literature hath led to the birth of a wondrous programming tongue, HamletCode. 'Tis a valiant quest to entwine the boundless muse of language with the steadfast logic of the code, that programming might becometh more delightful and captivating to the masses. Perchance, 'tis to be employ'd for the study and instruction of programming tenets in a manner both intriguing and pleasurable.
```

## Design
<br>

```
Design Tools : DCG, Prolog, Python (for tokenization), bash/executable to run the program
Data Structures: List

Flow : 
Bash code that takes program file as cli argument (eg. hamlet program.hamlet)
Internally it will run the following programs

- Python code to read the program file and generate tokens
- Prolog code that takes these tokens to create parse tree
- Prolog code that takes the parse tree to evaluate the output

```
